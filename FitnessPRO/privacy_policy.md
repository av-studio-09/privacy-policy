Fitness PRO ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the limited personal information that you provide when using our app.

Information We Collect
We only collect and store your weight to personalize your fitness experience. No other personal information is collected, stored, or shared.

How We Use Your Information
The weight you provide is used solely for calculating exercise metrics, such as calorie estimation and fitness tracking. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

Data Storage and Security
The weight data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties. We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but as the data is stored locally, you are responsible for ensuring the security of your device.

Sharing of Information
We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to any third parties. Since we collect no personal information beyond your weight, there are no circumstances under which we would share this data.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will notify you of any changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
